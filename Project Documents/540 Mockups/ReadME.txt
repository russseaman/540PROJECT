I would recommend that you guys start with scrolling though the included pdf of the mock ups. I think it does a good job or representing a flow to the project.

Key Callout:
I would like to point your attention to the ‘look up’ screens for the various sections. Each contains a grid view of sample data. A design consideration is that the leading ID for each row will be clickable, and take the user to the individual detail screen for the corresponding ID.

IE: User clicks on the ‘Product ID’ from the grid view on the ‘Product Lookup’ screen, they navigate to ‘View Product’ screen that shows details for that product. Likewise for transactions, customers, employees, ect.

Review the screens for your section in the given folders to ensure I didn’t miss any functionally for your given section. It was tedious towards the end and I want to ensure I didn’t overlook any features.

If you have suggestions for a remodel, or if features were left out please let me know.

Keep in mind that this is just a wire-frame mockup. Styling, details, and positioning of content can all be adjusted.

Thanks
