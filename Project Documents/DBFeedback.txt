DB FEEDBACK

1.) The schema looks as if you want to allow multiple addresses for an Employee? just making sure? (screenshots do not reflect this) What is the EmpAddressID in the Employee table?

2.) PurchaseOrder should be split into PurchaseOrder and PurchaseOrderItems. That way when you add multiple items to the PurchaseOrder you are not repeating the PurchaseOrderID and OrderDate for every item. Also, a quantity field would need to be added to this PurchaseOrderItems table.

3.) I don't remember seeing Customer Discount in the requirements document? How/where is this discount applied?

4.) Will returns go in the PurchaseOrder table?

5.) Why AddressEmp and AddressCust? Same fields, could be one table.
